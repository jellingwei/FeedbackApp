Steps to setup the application
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
2. Set up and run a MySQL database on port 3306 (as specified in `feedbackApplication/resources/application.properties`)
   Indicate a username and password for accessing the MySQL database in `feedbackApplication/resources/application.properties`.
3. Create the database: ``create database feedback_db;``
4. From the feedbackApplication directory, run `./mvnw clean spring-boot:run`. 
   By default, this runs the application on port 8080.
5. The application can be accessed on localhost:8080.


The app relies on http://processfeedback.atwebpages.com/submit.php?feedback=<input> for obtaining the feedback's status.
If the returned sentiment is positive, then the status is considered "Accepted". 
Otherwise, if the returned sentiment is negative, the status is considered "Rejected".
For other responses, or if the service does not return within 15s, the returned status is "Unknown (Try again later)"
